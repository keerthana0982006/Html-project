    <p><a href="">Galaxy</a>, any of the systems of stars and interstellar matter that make up the universe. Many such assemblages are so enormous that they contain hundreds of billions of <a href=""> stars</a>.A galaxy is a huge collection of gas, dust, and billions of stars and their <a href="">solar systems</a>. A galaxy is held together by gravity. Our galaxy, the Milky Way, also has a supermassive black hole in the middle. When you look up at stars in the night sky, you're seeing other stars in the <a href="">Milky Way</a>.A galaxy is best described as large groups of stars held together by <a href="">gravity</a>.</p>
    <p>The <a href="">solar system</a> stretches outward from the sun, passing the four inner <a href="">planets</a>, through the asteroid belt, past the four gas giants, and continues to the disk-shaped Kuiper Belt, extending even further to the teardrop-shaped heliopause.Our solar system is made up of a star—the Sun—eight planets, <a href="">146 moons</a>, a bunch of comets, asteroids and space rocks, ice, and several dwarf planets, such as <a href="">Pluto</a>Nature has provided an immensely varied array of galaxies, ranging from faint, diffuse dwarf objects to brilliant <a href="">spiral-shaped giants</a>. Virtually all galaxies appear to have been formed soon after the universe began, and they pervade space, even into the depths of the farthest reaches penetrated by powerful modern telescopes. Galaxies usually exist in clusters, some of which in turn are grouped into larger clusters that measure hundreds of millions of <a href="">light-years across</a>.</p>
    <p>he existence of <a href="">galaxies</a> was not recognized until the early <a href="">20th century</a>. Since then, however, galaxies have become one of the focal points of astronomical investigation. The notable developments and achievements in the study of galaxies are surveyed here. Included in the discussion are the external galaxies (i.e., those lying outside <a href="">the Milky Way Galaxy</a> , the local galaxy to which the Sun and Earth belong), their distribution in <a href="">clusters</a> and superclusters, and the evolution of galaxies and <a href="">quasars</a>. For further details on the Milky Way Galaxy, see Milky Way Galaxy. For specifics about the components of galaxies, see star and nebula.</p>
    <h2>Solar system</h2>

    <p>The <a href=""solar system></a> includes the <a href="">Sun, eight planets</a>, five officially named dwarf planets, and hundreds of moons, and thousands of asteroids and comets. Our solar system is located in the Orion Spur of the Milky Way, a barred spiral galaxy that's about <a href=""> 100,000 light years</a> across.The Solar System is the gravitationally bound system of the Sun and the objects that orbit it. It was formed about <a href="">4.6 billion</a> years ago when a dense region of a molecular <a href=""> cloud collapsed</a>, forming the Sun and a protoplanetary <a href=""></a>.</p>
    <p>The <a href="">largest </a> objects that orbit the Sun are the eight planets. In order from the Sun, they are four terrestrial planets (Mercury, Venus, Earth and Mars); two gas giants <a href="">(Jupiter and Saturn)</a>; and two ice giants (Uranus and Neptune). All terrestrial planets have solid surfaces. Inversely, all giant planets do not have a definite surface, as they are mainly composed of gases and liquids. Over <a href="">99.86%</a> of the Solar System's mass is in the Sun and nearly <a href="">90%</a> of the remaining mass is in Jupiter and Saturn.</p>
