      <h1>FLOWERS</h1>
      <p>
        A flower, also known as a bloom or blossom, is the reproductive
        structure found in flowering plants (plants of the division
        Angiospermae). Flowers consist of a combination of vegetative organs
        sepals that enclose and protect the developing flower. These petals
        attract pollinators, and reproductive organs that produce gametophytes,
        which in flowering plants produce gametes. The male gametophytes, which
        produce sperm, are enclosed within pollen grains produced in the
        anthers. The female gametophytes are contained within the ovules
        produced in the ovary.
