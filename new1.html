   <h1>ANIMALS</h1>
   <h2>Lion</h2>
<body>
   <P>The lion is a wild terrestrial animal called the king of the forest. The lion is a strong animal with a strong body, a big head, a majestic mane, and two fierce eyes. Lions are predatory animals and eat only after hunting. They have strong claws and sharp teeth, which help them hunt their prey and eat the flesh.</P>

   <h2>Giraffe</h2>
   <p>The largest captive herd of the northern Giraffe (29 individuals) in India is at the Alipore Zoological Garden in Kolkata. A recent genealogical study has confirmed that the individuals in this facility, at least, are most likely the Nubian giraffes or the Rothschild giraffe.</p>

   <h2>Fox</h2>
   <p>A fox is a small, dog-like wild animal with pointed ears and nose, and a thick tail. A red fox has dark front legs that look like little opera gloves. They're sneaky, so a fox can also be a tricky person. There are different kinds of foxes, but they all have a reputation for sneaking around and stealing stuff.</p>
